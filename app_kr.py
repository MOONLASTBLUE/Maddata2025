        - **Women**:
            - Generally have higher essential body fat percentages due to reproductive functions.
            - Estrogen promotes fat storage around the hips, thighs, and buttocks, providing reserves for pregnancy and childbearing.
            - This fat distribution poses lower cardiovascular risks compared to visceral fat.
        - **Men**:
            - Tend to accumulate visceral fat, primarily around the abdomen.
            - Visceral fat is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases.
            - Testosterone suppresses fat accumulation in non-abdominal areas, leading to these differences.

        Obesity significantly increases the risk of several chronic diseases and health conditions, including:
        
        1. **Cardiovascular Diseases**:
           - Excess body fat leads to increased blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and inflammation, which are major risk factors for heart attacks and strokes.
           - Studies show that obese individuals have a 50% higher risk of developing coronary artery disease.
        
        2. **Type 2 Diabetes**:
           - Obesity is the leading cause of insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.
           - Approximately 90% of individuals with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.
        
        3. **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**:
           - Excess weight puts additional strain on the heart, increasing blood pressure.
           - Obesity is estimated to contribute to 65-75% of cases of primary hypertension.
        
        4. **Certain Types of Cancer**:
           - Obesity is linked to cancers such as breast, colon, endometrial, and kidney cancer.
           - Adipose tissue produces excess estrogen and inflammation, which are associated with tumor growth.
        
        5. **Other Conditions**:
           - **Sleep Apnea**: Excess fat around the neck can block airways, causing breathing difficulties during sleep.
           - **Joint Problems**: Increased weight puts stress on joints, leading to osteoarthritis.
           - **Mental Health**: Obesity can contribute to depression and anxiety due to societal stigma and reduced quality of life.

        Physical activity is essential for maintaining a healthy weight and reducing obesity-related risks:
        
        - **Low FAF (Frequency of Physical Activity)** (less than 2 days/week): A sedentary lifestyle increases obesity risks.
        - **Moderate FAF** (3-5 days/week): Helps balance energy intake and expenditure, maintaining body weight.
        - **High FAF** (6+ days/week): Supports significant fat burning, builds muscle mass, and improves overall health.
        
        **Tips for Increasing Physical Activity**:
        - Start small by incorporating a 10-minute daily walk and gradually increase the duration.
        - Include strength training exercises twice a week to build muscle mass.

West Recreation Fields,"2100 Observatirt Drive, Madison, WI, 53706","The West Recreation Fields – the first project of the Master Plan – are now open for play. This is the first Rec Well outdoor facility with synthetic turf, meaning fewer cancelled games, longer seasons, and more opportunities for campus to play hard, get fit, and live well outside.

The fields are lined (painted) for a variety of sports, including baseball, softball, flag football, soccer, lacrosse, and more. Featuring more economical and environmentally conscious options for lighting and turf, we are excited to welcome students and members to this state-of-the-art facility, marking the beginning of a bright future for recreation on the UW-Madison campus.",Open Daily,Open Daily,Open Daily,Open Daily,https://recwell.wisc.edu/nearwest/,43.07814611,-89.42339149
East Recreation Fields,"1926 Observatory Drive, Madison, WI, 53706","The East Recreation Fields project will include the conversion of an existing four-acre (approximately 175,230-square foot (SF)) natural grass field into a large artificial turf field complex for sports and recreation use. Proposed fields include four intramural level soccer fields and one championship soccer/rugby field.

The project also includes updating lighting, fencing, installation of score boards, a public announcement (PA) system, a small building for storage and restrooms, landscaping, bicycle and moped parking, entries for maintenance and emergency medical service access, and a regional underground storm water management system (i.e., detention chamber) to collect sediment from a 32-acre watershed on campus.

Construction required for the project includes excavation and rebuilding of the field area, storm water connections to existing storm water pipes, and electric, heat, water and sewer connections to the new support buildings along the eastern boundary. Photovoltaic solar may also be incorporated into the project to generate electricity for the facility.",Open Daily,Open Daily,Open Daily,Open Daily,https://recwell.wisc.edu/near-east/,43.07705238,-89.4170943
